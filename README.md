![Me while coding](http://cdn.quotesgram.com/small/25/29/698608675-Programmers-Funny-Pictures-Coding-Jokes.jpg)

*My first creation of a webpage mock-up. I've included the target webpage as well so feel free to take a look and compare.*

What i've learned with during this project:

#HTML
* Practiced typing a full page into HTML form scratch.
* Used the `&nbsp;` command to add double spacing.
* How to properly nest a `span` inside of a `div` to create a circular button inside of a border.
* Better organization of classes and ids

#CSS
* How to place the `background-image` tag.
* MUCH Better understanding of how to use padding.
* MUCH Better understanding of how to use margins.
* Better understanding of the way floats work and how to apply them.

#Bonus
* How to apply `normalize.css` and what it does to a webpage.
